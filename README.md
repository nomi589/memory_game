## Introduction

A simple memory game. Match cards in pairs. The game is completed when all cards are matched.

## How to Play

1. Click on a card to reveal it's face.
2. Click on another card; if the two cards match, they remain face up. If they don't match, both cards turn face down.
3. Each time two cards are turned over, one move is recorded.
4. Match all 8 pairs to complete the game.
5. Once all the 8 pairs of cards have been matched, the final star-rating is shown alongwith the number of moves and the amount of time it took to complete the game.
6. The challenge is to keep the positions of the cards in your memory so the game is completed in fewer moves.

## Star-rating

Each game starts with 3 stars. Every time 12 moves are consumed, the number of stars is reduced by one.

So if the game is completed in less than 12 moves, you get 3 stars. If it is completed in less than 24 moves, you get 2 stars and so on.
